## Project 1 - Imaginary Law Enforcement Database (using SQL)
I demonstrated my ability to create databases by designing an imaginary law enforcement dataset using SQL. The Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) was informed by my academic expertise and practical understanding of criminal justice data.

### Police Records cases and Offences
**The data:**
- Contains details about criminal record cases, offenses committed, and associated data.

- Shows information about police records and cases through US police departments and information about the offences. One Record can conclude more than one offence.

- Provides detailed information about involvement in criminal incidents, categorized and analyzed based on police records and cases across various US police departments. The focus is on understanding the dynamics of offenses and the roles played by different individuals.

- Contains prisoner details during their imprisonment, including components related to the quality of life within correctional facilities.

- Information on prisoners/suspects and their unique incarceration features, linked to specific correctional facilities.

## Project 2 - SQL Queries with AdventureWorks2019
In my second project, I showcased my proficiency in using various SQL queries to extract relevant data from the AdventureWorks2019 database. This allowed me to apply my analytical skills.
## Project 3 - Python Data Presentation (Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib)
Leveraging Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, and Matplotlib, I visualized law enforcement data from my first project. The process involved ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) and data cleansing, followed by aggregative functions and matrix creation. The main focus was on evidence-based policy insights derived from unique visualizations.

This project delves into the intricate world of law enforcement across different states in the United States. By examining three critical areas, I aim to uncover insights, visualize trends, and enhance our understanding of criminal justice:

1. **Case Documentation and Crime Data:**
   - I explore the meticulous documentation and registration of police files and criminal incidents.
   - What patterns emerge? How do crime rates vary across states?

2. **Characteristics of Involved Parties:**
   - I delve into the profiles of both criminals and victims.
   - Who are the individuals affected by these crimes? What demographics play a role?

3. **Linking Criminals and Incarceration Facilities:**
   - My focus shifts to the unique features of incarceration for each prisoner or suspect.
   - How do these features intersect with the characteristics of the correctional facilities?

### Project Scope and Data

- **Imaginary Data:**
  - My dataset is based on fictional data, not a representative sample.
  - I synthesized this information using academic insights from criminology and statistical methodologies used by law enforcement agencies worldwide.

- **Three Key Data Frames:**
  1. **Cases and Offenses (rec_off):**
     - Contains details about criminal cases, offenses committed, and associated data.
  2. **Participants (inv_rec_off):**
     - Profiles of individuals involved in criminal incidents (both criminals and victims).
  3. **Prisoners and Facilities (inv_pris_det):**
     - Information on prisoners/suspects and their unique incarceration features, linked to specific correctional facilities.

### Workflow Overview

#### Each data frame follows a structured process:

1. **ETL Processes (Extract, Transform, Load):**
   - I refine and clean the raw data and add raw data, change data type for relevant columns, create null treatment for problematic values and ensuring accuracy and consistency.
   - Data quality is crucial for meaningful analysis.

2. **Aggregating Data for Reports:**
   - I summarize and aggregate relevant information.
   - Reports provide insights into crime patterns, demographics, and facility characteristics.

3. **Main Visualizations:**
   - Through charts, graphs, and visual representations, I bring the data to life.
   - Visualizations aid in understanding complex relationships.

### Evidence-Based Policing:
   - This resource discusses evidence-based policing, contrasting it with traditional models.
   - It emphasizes translating research into law enforcement practices.

### Cautionary Note

While my project provides valuable insights, remember that our data is fictional. Drawing conclusions requires caution, especially when applying findings to real-world scenarios.

Let's embark on this analytical journey, exploring the intersection of law, data, and justice.
## Project 4 - Power BI Live Visualizations (Imaginary Law Enforcement Data)
For my fourth project, I harnessed the power of Power BI to create dynamic and interactive visualizations. Using live data from my imaginary law enforcement dataset, I designed compelling dashboards and reports. These visualizations allowed stakeholders to explore crime trends, suspect profiles, and victim demographics in real time.
