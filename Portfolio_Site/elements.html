                    With an MA in Criminology and hands-on experience as a research and teaching assistant, I have specialized in crime analysis using various statistical methods and software, including SPSS and STATA. I am skilled in managing and analyzing diverse data sources such as crime reports, offender records, and prisoner surveys, and excel in critical thinking and communication for effectively presenting research findings. Recently, I completed a Data Analyst course where I gained practical experience in handling fictional law enforcement databases with SQL, visualizing data with Python libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, and Matplotlib, and producing detailed reports with Power BI. My coursework also included ETL processes, data cleansing, and creating dynamic dashboards. I am eager to apply my skills and continue developing my expertise as a Junior Data Analyst while pursuing my Ph.D. in Criminology.
